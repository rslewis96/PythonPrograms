# PythonPrograms

This purpose of this repository is to store and show case programs I have created for fun in Python.

**BaseNumberConverterGame.py:** This program is a base number game that will ask you the starting base of Binary, Octal, Decimal, or Hex and
then ask you the base you wish to convert the given number into. Example: Convert from Binary to Decimal. The program gives you 0b0111 and you give it 7. 
I don't have it currently programmed with x amount of tries before it gives you the answer. 

**WeatherForecaster.py:** This program will reach out to a backyard personal weather station (Sainlogic WS0835 Plus) via weathercloud and collect weather data. (To be added later... will add the ability to forecast up to 12 hrs based on the Zambretti Algorithm.)
